And since the limit is so small (starting out, anyway), the temptation to troll, posting useless answers, is minimized. This limit actually gives an incentive to post more to people who, out of egotism or the desire to help others, want to maximize their posts.

32605-Why Jews & Christains offend Muslims?
32605-Good question. Perhaps it's because Islam appeared significantly later than the other two monotheistic religions.. It's the more embarrassing for Christians and Jews, as all three religions ultimately share the belief in the same god, whether he's called God Almighty, Allah, or Jahwe.. On the other hand, religion has become less and less important in countries with dominantly Christian and/or Jewish cultural roots, whereas laicism is something not very widespread in Muslim countries, where you'll find a much more significant connection between state and religion.. As Christians or Jews of an era where we are being educated in the rational ways of Enlightenment we're used to being able to make fun of our own religion, so we may feel we're entitled to make fun of other people's religion too.. Which isn't always funny.

Other possibilities are either financially unfeasible, or infringes upon individual's privacy: More security cameras being monitored by additional personnel, drug sniff dogs patrolling the premise, undercover cops etc etc.

32605-Why Jews & Christains offend Muslims?
32605-Good question. Perhaps it's because Islam appeared significantly later than the other two monotheistic religions.. It's the more embarrassing for Christians and Jews, as all three religions ultimately share the belief in the same god, whether he's called God Almighty, Allah, or Jahwe.. On the other hand, religion has become less and less important in countries with dominantly Christian and/or Jewish cultural roots, whereas laicism is something not very widespread in Muslim countries, where you'll find a much more significant connection between state and religion.. As Christians or Jews of an era where we are being educated in the rational ways of Enlightenment we're used to being able to make fun of our own religion, so we may feel we're entitled to make fun of other people's religion too.. Which isn't always funny.

32625-how can schools prevent the selling of drugs?
32625-Harsher punishment (zero tolerance, immediate expulsion etc).. . Educate the kids to look out for such activities/dealers and each other. Most have misplaced "loyalty" to not "rat" out other kids who deal, but they must be taught that there are exceptions to the rule when it comes to drugs because it is potentially so harmful that it could ruin lives and families that it supercedes whatever "perceived" loyalty they have to each other, and they should be reported for the greater good so the dealers can be dealt with by the police.. . Other possibilities are either financially unfeasible, or infringes upon individual's privacy: More security cameras being monitored by additional personnel, drug sniff dogs patrolling the premise, undercover cops etc etc.
